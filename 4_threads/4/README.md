## th.4: Progress bars

- Implement a function to print a progress bar, through a sequence of `|'
  characters. The function shall take as arguments the percentage of the bar,
  and the maximum length (max number of characters). Use also a "sleep"
  function to simulate the progress of some real work.

- Call the function in the main()

- Use threads to implement a multi-threaded print, highlighting the difference
  in terms of speed, with respect to the sequential print.
