## c.4: Parking model: class with container data member

Create a class `Parking` to model a parking area with a fixed number of parking
spaces (slots). For each slot, we need to keep track of the status (is it free
or not?) and the model of the car parked (in the case).

The class must include member functions `park()`, `leave()` to update the
status of the parking area, according to cars arriving or leaving. The first
one will get the car model asargument, while the second it will require to
specify the slot from which to pick the leaving car.

The class must include also a member function returning the number of slots
currently free.

Implement a simple program showing the usage of the class.
