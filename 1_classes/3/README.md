## c.3: Implement the comparison operators

- Implement the `< operator` for the `Person` class, such that it would return
  `true` in case the left-hand object has a name lower than the right-hand one
  from the alphabetical order perspective (e.g., "Antonio" < "Michele" = true). 
- Implement also the operators `==` and `>` consequently
- Add some comparisons in the main to show the operator in action.
