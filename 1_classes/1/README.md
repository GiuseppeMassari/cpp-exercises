## c.1: Create a class and instantiate some objects

- Create a class called `Person`, containing the following data: name, city,
  gender and the related getter and setter functions (`get_name()`, `set_name()`,...).
- Declare a class constructor performing the member initialization of all the
  aforementioned member data.
- The gender type must be defined through a new enum class `Gender`.
- Instantiate some `Person` objects and print the name and city value for each
  of them.
