## c.5: Parking model: inherited class

Create a class `PaymentParking` derived from `Parking` which considers the time
elapsed between the arrival and the leaving time of the cars. The fee per hour
must be provided to the class constructor. When a car leaves the parking, a
message reporting also the amount to pay must be printed.

Implement a simple program showing the usage of the class. Use a sleep function
to simulate the elapsing time. Let's say 1 second = 1 hour in real life.
